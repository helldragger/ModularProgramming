# ModularProgramming
A new way to code projects, just add your generalized algorithms once in your algo database and just call them to insert them into your code! only work left is adapting the functions name and maybe tweaking the way you sort your data!

## What do I need in order to use it?

-  AHK in order to run the client on windows
-  ironAHK in order to run the client on linux
-  python 3.5+


## How does it works?

### Starting the server

Well, there's a start_server.py you just need to execute in order to start the server.
That's it!

### Stopping the server

Just access to the server terminal and press Ctrl + C in order to terminate the server

### Starting the client

Execute the start_client.ahk to start the keyboard hook and register the Shift + Space hotkey

### Using the client

Type on your favourite editor, then type your request like this:

<type of algorithm> <specific version> <language used>
ie: sorting simple python

Then select your request and type Shift + Space, that's it!

### Exiting the client

Use the hotkey Shift + Esc to terminate the client!

## How do I fill my database?

the database is the algorithms folder of this tool, it is used in the following format:

TYPE_OF_ALGORITHM/SPECIFIC_VERSION.LANGUAGE_EXTENSION

Please make sure you type it in upper case.
